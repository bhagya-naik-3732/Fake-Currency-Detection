# Note-Detection
determining  currency denomination and detecting where its counterfeit or not using ML

# To Run
` cd app `
` python main.py `

# Problem Statement 
 To identify the denomination of a note using Machine Learning based on an image.
 To design the present currency template in ATMâ€™s it requires 6-9 months.
 This is an attempt is to use Machine Learning(ML) to reduce this time.

# Introduction\Proposed solution
  CNNs are known to work better with Images as it works on a window(group of pixels)
  Used LeNET architecture which uses CNN and is simple to train on a CPU. 
  This model will classify the image given into one of the class.
  MLP(Multi-layer Perceptron) converts input into 1-D array, which causes loss of spatial correlation between the pixels
  counterfeit detection using auto-encoder technique
